        <h2>What is Diabetes?</h2>
        <p>
          Diabetes is a group of diseases that affect how the body uses blood
          sugar (glucose). Glucose is an essential source of energy for the
          body’s cells. When you have diabetes, your body either doesn't make
          enough insulin or can't use it properly. This leads to high blood
          sugar levels, which can cause a variety of serious health issues.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are two main types of diabetes: Type 1 diabetes and Type 2
          diabetes. While both types involve problems with insulin regulation,
          they have different causes and require different management
          strategies.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div className="section">
        <h2>Types of Diabetes</h2>
        <h3>1. Type 1 Diabetes</h3>
        <p>
          Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune condition where the body's immune
          system attacks and destroys the insulin-producing cells in the
          pancreas. This type of diabetes typically develops in children and
          young adults. People with Type 1 diabetes require daily insulin
          injections to manage their blood sugar levels.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Type 2 Diabetes</h3>
        <p>
          Type 2 diabetes is more common and occurs when the body becomes
          resistant to insulin or when the pancreas cannot produce enough
          insulin. This form of diabetes is most often linked to lifestyle
          factors such as poor diet, lack of exercise, and obesity. Type 2
          diabetes can often be managed with lifestyle changes and medication,
          but in some cases, insulin injections are required.
        </p>

        <h3>3. Gestational Diabetes</h3>
        <p>
          Gestational diabetes occurs during pregnancy when a woman’s body
          cannot produce enough insulin to meet the increased demands during
          pregnancy. Although it often resolves after childbirth, women who
          experience gestational diabetes are at a higher risk of developing
          Type 2 diabetes later in life.
        </p>

        <h3>4. Other Types of Diabetes</h3>
        <p>
          There are other, less common types of diabetes, including monogenic
          diabetes and secondary diabetes, which can result from other health
          conditions such as pancreatic diseases or steroid use.
        </p>

      <div className="section">
        <h2>Causes & Risk Factors</h2>
        <h3>1. Genetic Factors</h3>
        <p>
          Family history plays a significant role in the development of both
          Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. In Type 1 diabetes, the genetic
          predisposition combined with environmental factors triggers the immune
          response that destroys insulin-producing cells.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Poor Diet</h3>
        <p>
          A diet high in processed foods, sugars, and unhealthy fats increases
          the risk of Type 2 diabetes. Consuming high amounts of sugar and
          refined carbohydrates leads to insulin resistance and obesity, both of
          which contribute to the development of diabetes.
        </p>

        <h3>3. Obesity and Sedentary Lifestyle</h3>
        <p>
          Being overweight, especially with excess fat around the abdomen,
          significantly increases the risk of Type 2 diabetes. Physical
          inactivity can also lead to higher blood sugar levels and insulin
          resistance.
        </p>

        <h3>4. Age</h3>
        <p>
          The risk of Type 2 diabetes increases with age, especially after the
          age of 45. However, it is becoming more common in younger individuals
          due to rising obesity rates.
        </p>

        <h3>5. Ethnicity</h3>
        <p>
          Some ethnic groups, including African American, Hispanic, Native
          American, and Asian American populations, are more likely to develop
          Type 2 diabetes.
        </p>

        <h3>6. High Blood Pressure and High Cholesterol</h3>
        <p>
          People with high blood pressure or abnormal cholesterol levels are at
          a greater risk of developing Type 2 diabetes. These conditions are
          often linked to obesity and a sedentary lifestyle.

        <h2>Symptoms of Diabetes</h2>
        <p>
          The symptoms of diabetes can vary depending on the type, but common
          signs include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Increased thirst and frequent urination</li>
          <li>Extreme hunger</li>
          <li>Fatigue</li>
          <li>Blurry vision</li>
          <li>Slow-healing sores or frequent infections</li>
          <li>Unexplained weight loss (Type 1 Diabetes)</li>
          <li>Darkened skin in certain areas (Type 2 Diabetes)</li>
        </ul>

      <div className="section">
        <h2>Complications of Diabetes</h2>
        <h3>1. Heart Disease</h3>
        <p>
          Diabetes increases the risk of heart disease, including heart attacks,
          stroke, and peripheral artery disease, due to the damage high blood
          sugar causes to blood vessels and nerves.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Kidney Damage</h3>
        <p>
          High blood sugar can damage the kidneys over time, leading to diabetic
          nephropathy, which can result in kidney failure if untreated.
        </p>

        <h3>3. Nerve Damage</h3>
        <p>
          Prolonged high blood sugar can cause nerve damage (neuropathy),
          leading to tingling, pain, or loss of feeling in the extremities,
          particularly in the feet.
        </p>

        <h3>4. Eye Problems</h3>
        <p>
          Diabetes increases the risk of eye diseases such as diabetic
          retinopathy, cataracts, and glaucoma, which can result in blindness if
          untreated.
        </p>

        <h3>5. Foot Problems</h3>
        <p>
          Diabetes can lead to poor circulation and nerve damage in the feet,
          making them prone to infections, ulcers, and, in severe cases,
          amputation.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div className="section">
        <h2>Prevention & Management</h2>
        <h3>1. Healthy Eating</h3>
        <p>
          A balanced diet is essential for managing diabetes and preventing Type
          2 diabetes. Focus on whole grains, vegetables, lean proteins, and
          healthy fats, while limiting sugary and processed foods.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Physical Activity</h3>
        <p>
          Regular physical activity helps control blood sugar levels and
          improves insulin sensitivity. Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate
          exercise most days of the week.
        </p>

        <h3>3. Weight Management</h3>
        <p>
          Maintaining a healthy weight helps reduce the risk of Type 2 diabetes
          and can improve blood sugar control for those already diagnosed.
        </p>

        <h3>4. Medication</h3>
        <p>
          People with Type 1 diabetes require insulin injections, while those
          with Type 2 diabetes may be prescribed medications to help regulate
          blood sugar levels. Medications include oral drugs like metformin, as
          well as insulin therapy for more severe cases.
        </p>

        <h3>5. Regular Monitoring</h3>
        <p>
          Regular monitoring of blood glucose levels is essential for both Type
          1 and Type 2 diabetes to ensure they stay within the target range.
          This can help prevent complications.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          Diabetes is a serious condition, but with proper management, people
          with diabetes can lead healthy, fulfilling lives. By adopting healthy
          lifestyle habits, regularly monitoring blood sugar levels, and
          following medical advice, diabetes can be managed effectively.

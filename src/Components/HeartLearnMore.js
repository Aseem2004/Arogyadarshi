        <h2>What is Heart Disease?</h2>
        <p>
          Heart disease refers to a variety of conditions that affect the
          heart's structure and function. This includes coronary artery disease,
          heart attacks, arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats), heart failure, and
          valvular heart disease. Cardiovascular diseases remain the leading
          cause of death globally, with millions of people affected each year.
        </p>
        <p>
          It often develops due to a combination of risk factors, such as poor
          diet, lack of physical activity, high cholesterol, high blood
          pressure, smoking, and genetic predisposition.

        <h2>Types of Heart Disease</h2>
        <h3>1. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)</h3>
        <p>
          Coronary artery disease is the most common type of heart disease. It
          occurs when the coronary arteries become narrowed or blocked due to
          plaque buildup, restricting blood flow to the heart. This condition
          can lead to chest pain (angina), heart attacks, or heart failure.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Heart Attack</h3>
        <p>
          A heart attack (myocardial infarction) occurs when blood flow to a
          part of the heart is blocked for an extended period. This can damage
          or destroy heart muscle tissue, impairing its ability to pump blood
          effectively.
        </p>

        <h3>3. Arrhythmias</h3>
        <p>
          Arrhythmias are abnormal heart rhythms. They can occur when the
          electrical impulses that regulate the heart's beats become disrupted.
          Some arrhythmias are harmless, but others can cause the heart to beat
          too fast, too slow, or irregularly, leading to complications.
        </p>

        <h3>4. Heart Failure</h3>
        <p>
          Heart failure doesn't mean the heart has stopped working, but rather
          that it is no longer able to pump blood effectively to meet the body's
          needs. It can result from damage to the heart muscle due to previous
          heart attacks, hypertension, or coronary artery disease.
        </p>

        <h3>5. Valvular Heart Disease</h3>
        <p>
          This occurs when one or more of the heart's valves are damaged or
          diseased. The valves control the flow of blood through the heart, and
          problems with them can lead to poor blood circulation, increasing the
          risk of heart failure.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div className="section">
        <h2>Causes & Risk Factors</h2>
        <h3>1. High Cholesterol</h3>
        <p>
          High levels of cholesterol in the blood can lead to plaque buildup in
          the arteries, causing them to narrow and harden. This restricts blood
          flow and increases the risk of heart disease.
        </p>

        <h3>2. High Blood Pressure (Hypertension)</h3>
        <p>
          Consistently high blood pressure puts extra strain on the heart and
          arteries, increasing the risk of heart attacks and stroke. Over time,
          it can damage the heart and blood vessels.
        </p>

        <h3>3. Smoking</h3>
        <p>
          Smoking damages the blood vessels, lowers oxygen levels in the blood,
          raises blood pressure, and accelerates the process of plaque buildup
          in the arteries. Smokers are at a much higher risk of heart disease
          than non-smokers.
        </p>

        <h3>4. Sedentary Lifestyle</h3>
        <p>
          Lack of physical activity can lead to obesity, high cholesterol, and
          high blood pressure, all of which increase the risk of heart disease.
          Regular exercise can help maintain a healthy weight and reduce heart
          disease risk.
        </p>

        <h3>5. Diabetes</h3>
        <p>
          Having diabetes, particularly if it is poorly controlled, increases
          the risk of heart disease. High blood sugar levels can damage the
          blood vessels and lead to plaque buildup in the arteries.
        </p>

        <h3>6. Family History</h3>
        <p>
          A family history of heart disease increases the likelihood of
          developing heart disease yourself, especially if a parent or sibling
          had heart disease at an early age.
        </p>

        <h3>7. Stress</h3>
        <p>
          Chronic stress can contribute to heart disease by causing an increase
          in blood pressure and promoting unhealthy behaviors like overeating or
          smoking.
        </p>

      <div className="section">
        <h2>Symptoms of Heart Disease</h2>
        <p>
          The symptoms of heart disease can vary depending on the type of
          condition and its severity. Common signs include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Chest pain or discomfort (angina)</li>
          <li>Shortness of breath</li>
          <li>Fatigue or weakness</li>
          <li>Irregular heartbeats (palpitations)</li>
          <li>Swelling in the legs, ankles, or feet</li>
          <li>Dizziness or lightheadedness</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div className="section">
        <h2>Preventive Measures & Lifestyle Changes</h2>
        <h3>1. Eat Heart-Healthy Foods</h3>
        <p>
          A balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean
          proteins, and healthy fats can help lower cholesterol and reduce the
          risk of heart disease.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Exercise Regularly</h3>
        <p>
          Engaging in regular physical activity helps maintain a healthy weight,
          lower blood pressure, and reduce cholesterol levels.
        </p>

        <h3>3. Quit Smoking</h3>
        <p>
          Smoking cessation can significantly reduce the risk of heart disease
          by improving circulation and reducing plaque buildup in the arteries.
        </p>

        <h3>4. Manage Stress</h3>
        <p>
          Practice stress-management techniques such as yoga, meditation, or
          deep breathing to lower the risk of heart disease.
        </p>

        <h3>5. Monitor Blood Pressure & Cholesterol</h3>
        <p>
          Regular monitoring and managing blood pressure and cholesterol levels
          can help prevent heart disease or minimize its progression.
        </p>

        <h3>6. Maintain a Healthy Weight</h3>
        <p>
          Maintaining a healthy body weight through a balanced diet and regular
          exercise can lower the strain on your heart and reduce the risk of
          heart disease.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div className="section">
        <h2>Treatment Options</h2>
        <h3>1. Medications</h3>
        <p>
          Medications such as statins, blood thinners, and blood
          pressure-lowering drugs can help control risk factors and reduce the
          likelihood of a heart attack or stroke.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Lifestyle Changes</h3>
        <p>
          Lifestyle changes such as eating a heart-healthy diet, quitting
          smoking, and engaging in regular exercise can significantly improve
          heart health and reduce the risk of heart disease.
        </p>

        <h3>3. Surgical Procedures</h3>
        <p>
          In some cases, surgical interventions may be necessary, such as
          coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), angioplasty, or valve
          repair/replacement.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          Heart disease remains a major health issue, but many risk factors are
          modifiable. With early detection, lifestyle changes, and appropriate
          medical intervention, it is possible to manage and even prevent the
          progression of heart disease. Regular checkups and being proactive
          about your heart health are key to a long and healthy life.
